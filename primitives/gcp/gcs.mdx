title: 'GCS Bucket'

GCSBucket is a sink primitive that can be used to write various files to a GCS bucket.  The sink primitive takes in a file path and will create one unique file per replica. To create a GCSBucket provide:

Description of the primitive. Folowed by arguments:

| Arg             | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **project_id**  | The project ID where the GCS bucket lives                                                                                                                                   |
| **bucket_name** | The name of the bucket                                                                                                                                                      |
| **file_path**   | The base path of the file to write to. We will take this path and generate a unique file path for each replica in the following format:  ` {file_path}-{uuid}.{extension} ` |
| **file_format** | The file format to write valid options are: JSON, CSV, and PARQUET                                                                                                          |

<Note>
    `file_path` and `file_format` are only used if you are using GCSBucket as a sink.
</Note>

Example usage:

```python
from buildflow.io.gcp import GCSBucket

bucket = GCSBucket(
    project_id="project",
    bucket_name="bucket",
    file_path="path/to/file_in_bucket",
    file_format="PARQUET")
    
app.manage(bucket)

@app.consumer(source=..., sink=bucket)
```



## Types
The GCSBucket sink expects an object that can be serialized in to a JSON object. You can return a `dataclass` and we will automatically serialize it for you, or you can return a dictionary containing JSON serializable objects.

If you would like to return a custom type that is not JSON serializable you can implement the `to_json` method on your class and we will use that to serialize your object.

```python
class CustomType:
    def __init__(self, b: int):
        self.b = str

    def to_json(self):
        return {"b": self.b}

bucket = GCSBucket(
    project_id="project",
    bucket_name="bucket",
    file_path="path/to/file_in_bucket",
    file_format="PARQUET")
    
app.manage(bucket)

@app.consumer(source=..., sink=bucket)
async def my_processor(elem: int) -> CustomType:
    return CustomType(b=elem + 1)
```

## Resource Creation

If you are using BuildFlow's built in resource creation/management you can use the GCSBucket primitive to create a GCS Bucket in your provided project.


## Configuration Options

You can provide the following options to control resource management of the GCS bucket:

| Options       | Description                                                                        |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| force_destroy | If true destroy will fail if the bucket contains objects. Defaults to  ` False ` . |
| bucket_region | The region to create the bucket it.                                                |


```python
primitive = GCSBucket(...).options(force_destroy=True, bucket_region="US")
```

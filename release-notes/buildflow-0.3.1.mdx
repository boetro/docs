BuildFlow 0.3.1 contains some minor bug fixes.

- Allow test event from S3 notifications to be ignored.
- Remove `motherduck_token` from DuckDBTable primitive. Instead users should set this as an environment variable.
- Fix bug in S3FileChangeStream primitive where it failed to fetch the blob if the name contained spaces in it.

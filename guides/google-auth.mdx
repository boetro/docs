title: "Authenticate Users with Google"
---

In this guide we will implement the [OAuth2 Web Server flow](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#webserver) with BuildFlow, and allow users to login to our application.
All the code for this guide can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-templates/tree/main/samples/google-auth).

To do this we will use:

- [endpoints](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints): to create necessary endpoints for authentication
- [Google auth dependency](/buildflow/dependencies/auth#authenticated-google-user): to ensure requests are properly authenticated

To see a full working application example with a UI included see our [SaaS application example](/buildflow/examples/saas).


<Steps>
    <Step title="Initialize Flow">
        First we create a new BuildFlow [Flow](/buildflow/programming-guide/flows). This will be the main entry point to our application.

        ```python
        app = Flow()
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Attach a Service">
        We then attach a service to our flow object and ensure that the [SessionMiddleware](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints#sessionmiddleware) to allow us to store credentials in a session.

        ```python
        service = app.service(service_id="auth-sample")
        service.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=str(uuid.uuid4()))
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Define Auth Dependency">
        Next we define a [dependency](/buildflow/programming-guide/dependencies) that will consume an incoming HTTP request and validate the user is authenticated with Google.

        <Note>
            We set `raise_on_unauthenticated=False` to ensure that if the user is not authenticated, the dependency will return `None` instead of raising an exception.
            This allows us to issue a redirect to our login page.
        </Note>

        ```python
        # Set up a google user if the user is authenticated
        # We use `session_id_token` to indicate we can use "token_id" from the session
        # to fetch the user id token.
        MaybeAuthenticatedGoogleUser = AuthenticatedGoogleUserDepBuilder(
            session_id_token="id_token", raise_on_unauthenticated=False
        )
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add a Serving Endpoint">
        Now we can add a serving [endpoint](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) to our service. This endpoint will say hello to the user, or redirect them to the login page if they have not logged in.

        You see that we consume our `MaybeAuthenticatedGoogleUser` dependency to get the user's information for each request to the endpoint.

        ```python
        @service.endpoint(route="/", method="GET")
        async def index(user_dep: MaybeAuthenticatedGoogleUser) -> str:
            if user_dep.google_user is None:
                return RedirectResponse("/auth/login")
            return f"Hello {user_dep.google_user.name}"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup our Google OAuth Client">
        We use the [google-auth-oauthlib](https://pypi.org/project/google-auth-oauthlib/) client library to setup an OAuth client for authenticating with Google. This library takes in a [client configuration](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/docs/client-secrets.md) that is pointed at your configured [OAuth2 Credentials](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en).
        We wrap our client in a [dependency](/buildflow/programming-guide/dependencies) so that we can inject it into our endpoints.

        <Tip>
        This config looks for your client ID and client secret as environment variables.
        </Tip>

        ```python
        @dependency(scope=Scope.REPLICA)
        class AuthFlow:
            def __init__(self):
                self.client = google_auth_flow.Flow.from_client_config(
                    {
                        "web": {
                            "client_id": os.environ["CLIENT_ID"],
                            "client_secret": os.environ["CLIENT_SECRET"],
                            "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
                            "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
                            "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
                            "redirect_uris": [
                                "http://localhost:8000/auth/callback/google",
                            ],
                            "javascript_origins": "http://localhost:8000",
                        }
                    },
                    scopes=[
                        "openid",
                        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
                        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile",
                    ],
                )
                self.client.redirect_uri = "http://localhost:8000/auth/callback/google"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Auth Endpoints">
    Finally we add two [endpoints](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) for authenticating a user with Google.

    - **/auth/login**: This endpoint is where a user is redirected to login. It uses our google OAuth client to generate an authorization URL and redirects the user to that URL.
    - **/auth/callback/google**: This endpoint is where Google redirects the user after they have logged in. We fetch the user's ID token and store it in the session.

    ```python
    @service.endpoint(route="/auth/login", method="GET")
    async def auth_login(auth_flow: AuthFlow):
        authorization_url, state = auth_flow.client.authorization_url(
            access_type="offline",
            include_granted_scopes="true",
            approval_prompt="force",
        )
        return RedirectResponse(authorization_url)


    def fetch_id_token(code: str, auth_flow: AuthFlow) -> str:
        creds = dict(auth_flow.client.fetch_token(code=code))
        return creds["id_token"]


    @service.endpoint("/auth/callback/google", method="GET")
    async def auth_callback(request: Request, auth_flow: AuthFlow):
        code = request.query_params.get("code")
        if code is None:
            raise HTTPException(401)
        user_id_token = fetch_id_token(code, auth_flow)
        request.session["id_token"] = user_id_token
        return RedirectResponse("/")
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the Code">
    Before running either update the code to use your own client ID and client secret, or set the environment variables `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` to your own values.

    You can now run the code locally with the VS Code extension or by running the below command in the root directory of the application:

    ```
    buildflow run
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

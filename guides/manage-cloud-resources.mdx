title: "Manage Cloud Resources"
---

{/* TODO: should probably have the code for this walkthrough somewhere the user can stumble through it */}

BuildFlow applications can manage their own infrastructure state. This removes the need for a separate configuration management tool such as Terraform, or from managing your resources manually in the cloud console.

To do this you simply mark your [primitives](/buildflow/programming-guide/primitives) as managed by your [Flow](/buildflow/programming-guide/flows) and BuildFlow will take care of the rest.

To see a full working application example with a UI included see our [Image Classification example](/buildflow/examples/image-classification).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Initialize Flow">
        First we create a new BuildFlow [Flow](/buildflow/programming-guide/flows). This will be the main entry point to our application.

        ```python
        app = Flow()
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Define our Primitives">
        Now we define the [primitives](/buildflow/programming-guide/primitives) we would like to be managed. In our example we define an [S3Bucket](/buildflow/primitives/aws/s3) and a [GCPPubSubTopic](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/pubsub).

        ```python
        bucket = S3Bucket(bucket_name="my-bucket", aws_region="us-east-1")
        topic = GCPPubSubTopic(topic_name="my-topic", project_id=os.environ["GCP_PROJECT_ID"])
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Mark our Primitives as Managed">
        Finally we mark our primitives as managed by our Flow. This tells your application that it is responsible for creating, updating, and destroying these resources.

        ```python
        app.manage(bucket, topic)
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Preview our Changes">
        Now we can use the VS Code extension or the BuildFlow CLI to preview our changes:

        ```
        buildflow preview
        ```

        This will output the changes that will be made to our resources. In our case we will see that a new S3 bucket and GCP PubSub topic will be created.

        ```
        Primitives to create:
        ---------------------
        ├── S3Bucket
        │   └── s3://my-bucket
        └── GCPPubSubTopic
            └── my-project/my-topic
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Apply our Changes">
        If we're happy with the preview we can now use the VS Code extension or BuildFlow CLI to apply our changes.

        ```
        buildflow apply
        ```

        This will again output the preview and ask you to confirm.

        <Tip>
            You can use [FlowOptions](/buildflow/programming-guide/flows#infrastructure) to disable the confirmation requirement.
        </Tip>

        After this step you should be able to view your resources in the cloud console.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update our Resources">
        If we ever change our resources, for example updating a configuration option on our bucket or topic, we can run `buildflow apply` again to have the resource updated.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Destroy your Resources">
        If you ever want to delete all of the resources for your application, you can simply run `buildflow destroy`. Similar to apply this will preview the changes and ask you to confirm.

        If you no longer need a resource for your application you can simply remove it from being managed and when you run `buildflow apply` it will be deleted. For example if we no longer needed our S3 bucket we could remove it from our call to `app.manage`:

        ```
        app.manage(topic)
        ```

        Run:

        ```
        buildflow apply
        ```

        And you will see that the S3 bucket is deleted.
    </Step>

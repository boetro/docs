<Tip>
    Follow along with this walkthrough in your code editor using [LaunchFlow's VSCode extension](https://docs.launchflow.com/walkthroughs/file-ingestion)
</Tip>


In this walkthrough we will create an endpoint to upload images to a bucket and then run them through an image classification model using [ImageAI](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI).

Before completing the walkthrough ensure you have [installed BuildFlow](/programming-guide/install)
with all [extra dependencies](/programming-guide/install#extra-dependencies).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone the GitHub Repo">
<Tabs groupId="cloud-types">
  <Tab title="GCP">
    To run this walkthrough on resources created on GCP use [this github repo](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-gcp-image-classification).
    <Note>    
        In order to run this code you will need to have a GCP project created that you have access to.

        Follow the [Google Cloud Walkthrough](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) to create a new one if you need to.
    </Note>
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:launchflow/buildflow-gcp-image-classification.git 
    cd buildflow-gcp-image-classification
    ```

  <Tab title="AWS">
    To run this walkthrough using AWS and Snowflake resources use [this github repo](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-aws-image-classification)
    <Note>
    In order to run this code you will need to have a AWS and Snowflake account created that you have access to.

    Follow the [AWS Walkthrough](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html) to create a new one if you need to.

    You can signup for a Snowflake trial account [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-trial-account#signing-up-for-a-trial-account).

  <Tab title="Local">
    To run this using no remote resources use [this github repo](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-local-image-classification)

```
git clone git@github.com:launchflow/buildflow-local-image-classification.git 
cd buildflow-local-image-classification
```

    <Step title="Install your requirements">
        ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a .env file">
        Copy the `template.env` to `.env` and update all variables
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your resources">
        <Tip>
            If you are following the local walkthrough you can skip this step.
        </Tip> 
        Create all the resources that are required for your system.
        ```
            buildflow apply
        ```
        <Tip>
            Make sure you have logged in with your cloud provider before running this command.
        </Tip>

        This will output every primitive that will be created, and ask you to confirm before creating them.
        Depending on your cloud provider it will look like:

        ```
            Primitives to create:

In this walkthrough we will create an endpoint to upload images to a bucket and then run them through an image classification model using [ImageAI](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI).

Before completing the walkthrough ensure you have [installed BuildFlow](/programming-guide/install)
with all [extra dependencies](/programming-guide/install#extra-dependencies).

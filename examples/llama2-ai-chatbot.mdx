title: Llama 2 Chat Bot
icon: rocketchat
description: "Serve a Llama 2 Model hosted in a remote storage bucket."
---

In this example we will create a chatbot that uses the Llama2 7b chat model. All the code for this example can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-templates/tree/main/walkthroughs/llama2-chat-bot).

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/model-serving-design-light.gif"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/model-serving-design-dark.gif"
/>

Our application will:

1. Download our model from remote storage in a [dependency](/buildflow/programming-guide/dependencies) ensuring the model is ready before we receive traffic, and it can be shared across requests.
2. Expose an [endpoint](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) that allows chat with the model
3. When our endpoint is called it will send the request through the model and return the response.

If all goes well, you should have a working chatbot that looks like this:

## Run the Example

Before completing the example ensure you have [installed BuildFlow](/buildflow/programming-guide/install)
with all [extra dependencies](/buildflow/programming-guide/install#extra-dependencies).

<Tip>
  Our basic model is hosted on a public bucket, but you can also host your own
  model on a private bucket.
</Tip>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone the GitHub Repo">
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:launchflow/launchflow-model-serving.git
    cd launchflow-model-serving
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install your dependencies">
        ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run your application">
        Run your application with:

        ```
            buildflow run
        ```

        <Tip>
            If you want to experiment loading the model from S3 instead of GCS simply set `USE_GCP=false` in the `.env` file
        </Tip>

        Once running you can visit http://localhost:8000 to begin chatting with the AI!
    </Step>
    <Step title="What's next?">
        Now that you have a working chatbot, you can start to customize it to your needs. Such as adding [google auth](/buildflow/guides/google-auth) for user authentication or a [postgres database](/buildflow/guides/serve-from-postgres) for permanent storage. Or even hosting your own model on a private bucket.
    </Step>

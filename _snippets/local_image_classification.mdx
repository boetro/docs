        <Tip>
            We provide a picture of [Caleb's](https://github.com/boetro) dog in the repo to help get you started!

    </Step>
    <Step title="What's next?">
        Now that you have a working image classification app, you can start to customize it to your needs. Such as adding [google auth](/buildflow/guides/google-auth) for user authentication or a [postgres database](/buildflow/guides/serve-from-postgres) for permanent storage. Or even hosting your own model on a private bucket.

    <Step title="What's next?">
        Now that you have a working image classification app, you can start to customize it to your needs. Such as adding [google auth](/buildflow/guides/google-auth) for user authentication or a [postgres database](/buildflow/guides/serve-from-postgres) for permanent storage. Or even hosting your own model on a private bucket.

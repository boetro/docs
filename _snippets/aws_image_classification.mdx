        This will output every primitive that will be created, and ask you to confirm before creating them:

        ```
            Primitives to create:
            ---------------------
            ├── S3Bucket
            │   └── s3://caleb-aws-buildflow-image-classification
            ├── S3FileChangeStream
            │   └── caleb-aws-buildflow-image-classification:caleb-aws-buildflow-image-classification_queue
            └── SQSQueue
                └── us-east-1-caleb-aws-buildflow-image-classification_queue


            Would you like to apply these changes?
            Enter "y (yes)" to confirm, "n (no) to reject": 
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run your project">
        Run your project with:

        ```
            buildflow run
        ```

        Once running you can visit http://localhost:8000 to see and begin uploading images!

        <Tip>
            We provide a picture of [Caleb's](https://github.com/boetro) dog in the repo to help get you started!

        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="What's next?">
        Now that you have a working image classification app, you can start to customize it to your needs. Such as adding [google auth](/buildflow/guides/google-auth) for user authentication or a [postgres database](/buildflow/guides/serve-from-postgres) for permanent storage. Or even hosting your own model on a private bucket.

Our application will:
1. Expose an [endpoint](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) that allows users to upload images
2. When our endpoint receives an image, it will upload the image to a bucket ([GCS](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/gcs) or [S3](/buildflow/primitives/aws/s3))
3. When the image is uploaded it will trigger a notification to our queue ([GCP Pub/Sub](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/pubsub) or [AWS SQS](/buildflow/primitives/aws/sqs))
4. Our [consumer]((/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints)) will receive this notification and run the image through an image classification model using [ImageAI](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI)
5. The results of the image classification will be stored in a data warehouse ([BigQuery]((/buildflow/primitives/gcp/bigquery)) or [DuckDB](/buildflow/primitives/duckdb))
6. The data warehouse will be exposed by another endpoint

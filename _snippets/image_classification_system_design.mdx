Our application will:
1. Load our model from local storage in a [dependency](/buildflow/programming-guide/dependencies) ensuring the model is ready before we receive image uploads, and it can be shared across requests.
2. Expose an [endpoint](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) that allows users to upload images
3. When our endpoint receives an image, it will upload the image to a bucket ([GCS](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/gcs) or [S3](/buildflow/primitives/aws/s3))
4. When the image is uploaded it will trigger a notification to our queue ([GCP Pub/Sub](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/pubsub) or [AWS SQS](/buildflow/primitives/aws/sqs))
5. Our [consumer]((/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints)) will receive this notification and run the image through an image classification model using [ImageAI](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI)
6. The results of the image classification will be stored in a data warehouse ([BigQuery]((/buildflow/primitives/gcp/bigquery)) or [DuckDB](/buildflow/primitives/duckdb))
7. The data warehouse will be exposed by another endpoint

If all goes well, you should have a working image classification app like this:

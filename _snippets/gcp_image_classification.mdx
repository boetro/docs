    To run this example on resources created on GCP use [this github repo](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-gcp-image-classification).
    <Note>    
        In order to run this code you will need to have a GCP project created that you have access to.

        Follow the [Google Cloud Walkthrough](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) to create a new one if you need to.
    </Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone the GitHub Repo">
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:launchflow/buildflow-gcp-image-classification.git 
    cd buildflow-gcp-image-classification
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install your requirements">
        ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a .env file">
        Rename the `template.env` to `.env` and update all variables
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your resources">
        Create all the resources that are required for your system.
        ```
            buildflow apply
        ```
        <Tip>
            Make sure you have logged in with GCP with: `gcloud auth login --update-adc`
        </Tip>

        This will output every primitive that will be created, and ask you to confirm before creating them:

        ```bash
            Primitives to create:
            ---------------------
            ├── GCSBucket
            │   └── gcs://<GCP_PROJECT_ID>-image-classification
            ├── BigQueryDataset
            │   └── <GCP_PROJECT_ID>.buildflow_image_classification_walkthrough
            ├── BigQueryTable
            │   └── <GCP_PROJECT_ID>.buildflow_image_classification_walkthrough.image_classification
            ├── GCSFileChangeStream

            ├── GCPPubSubSubscription
            │   └── <GCP_PROJECT_ID>/<GCP_PROJECT_ID>-image-classification_subscription
            └── GCPPubSubTopic

            Enter "y (yes)" to confirm, "n (no) to reject":
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run your project">
        Run your project with:

        ```
            buildflow run
        ```

        Once running you can visit http://localhost:8000 to see and begin uploading images!

        <Tip>
            We provide a picture of [Caleb's](https://github.com/boetro) dog in the repo to help get you started!

        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="What's next?">
        Now that you have a working image classification app, you can start to customize it to your needs. Such as adding [google auth](/buildflow/guides/google-auth) for user authentication or a [postgres database](/buildflow/guides/serve-from-postgres) for permanent storage. Or even hosting your own model on a private bucket.

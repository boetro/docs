    To run this walkthrough on resources created on GCP use [this github repo](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-gcp-image-classification).
    <Note>    
        In order to run this code you will need to have a GCP project created that you have access to.

        Follow the [Google Cloud Walkthrough](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) to create a new one if you need to.
    </Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone the GitHub Repo">

    git clone git@github.com:launchflow/buildflow-gcp-image-classification.git 
    cd buildflow-gcp-image-classification
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install your requirements">
        ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a .env file">
        Rename the `template.env` to `.env` and update all variables
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your resources">
        Create all the resources that are required for your system.
        ```
            buildflow apply
        ```
        <Tip>
            Make sure you have logged in with GCP with: `gcloud auth login --update-adc`
        </Tip>

        This will output every primitive that will be created, and ask you to confirm before creating them:

            Would you like to apply these changes?
            Enter "y (yes)" to confirm, "n (no) to reject":
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run your project">
        Run your project with:

        ```
            buildflow run
        ```

        Once running you can visit http://localhost:8000 to see and begin uploading images!

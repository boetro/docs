## Manage BuildFlow with LaunchFlow

[LaunchFlow](https://launchflow.com) is the fastest way to deploy your BuildFlow project with zero configuration. LaunchFlow gives you all the production best practices to ensure your system is scalable and reliable.

- Instant deployments with the click of a button

## Self-Hosting

You can also self host your BuildFlow project on any [Ray cluster](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/getting-started.html). We recommend deploying to a Ray cluster using the [Ray Jobs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/running-applications/job-submission/index.html) API like:

```bash
ray job submit \
    --runtime-env-json='{"pip": ["requirements.txt"]}' \
    --working-dir . \
    -- buildflow run
```

## Other Services

You can also run your BuildFlow project on any other service that offers managed ray. Such as [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com).

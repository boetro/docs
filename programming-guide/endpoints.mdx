The **Endpoint** pattern enables serving HTTP traffic via an API. 

A endpoint is composed of:
- A `route`: this is the path that the endpoint will be available at.
- A `method`: this is the HTTP method that the endpoint will be available at currently GET and POST are supported.
- Your processing Logic.

Endpoints are created as part of a `Service`. A Service is a collection of endpoints that all share the same set of resources.

A service can be created by call `app.service()`. This will create a service that is automatically attached to the flow.

```python
from buildflow import Flow

app = Flow()
service = app.service()
```

You can also manually create a service add attach it with `app.add_service(service)`

```python
from buildflow import Flow, Service

app = Flow()
service = Service()
app.add_service(service)
```

Endpoints can be attached to a service with the `@service.endpoint(...)` decorator.

```python
from buildflow import Flow

app = Flow()
service = app.service()

@service.endpoint(route="/", method="POST")
def my_endpoint(...):
    ...
```

Or by calling `service.add_endpoint(...)` and using the `@endpoint` decorator.

```python
from buildflow import Flow, endpoint

app = Flow()
service = app.service()

@endpoint(route="/", method="POST")
def my_endpoint(...):
    ...
service.add_endpoint(my_endpoint)
```

## Request and Response Type

### JSON Request Body and Response

The input of your collector will be one request from your HTTP endpoint.
If you endpoint is processing a JSON payload you can specify a dataclass type, and the JSON will be automatically deserialized into that type.
Similar for responses, if you return a dataclass it will be serialized to JSON.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from buildflow import Flow

@dataclass
class MyType:
    val: int

app = Flow()
service = app.service()

@service.endpoint(route="/", method="POST")
def my_endpoint(request: MyType) -> MyType:
    return request
```

### Query parameters

With endpoints you can also define query parameters. The query is the key-value pairs that go after the `?` in the URL.

```python
from buildflow import Flow

service = app.service()

@service.endpoint(route="/my_endpoint", method="GET")
def my_endpoint(my_int: int) -> int:
    return request
```

Requests to this URL would look like:

```
http://localhost/my_endpoint?my_int=1
```

### Raw Request

If you need access to the entire request you can also import `from buildflow.requests import Request`. If you do this no validation will be performed but you will have access to all the request data.

<Note>
    `buildflow.requests.Request` is just a proxy for the [starlette.requests.Request](https://www.starlette.io/requests/) object.

    We simply provide it as a convenience to avoid having to import `starlette.requests.Request` directly.
</Note>

```python
from buildflow import Flow
from buildflow.requests import Request

app = Flow()
service = app.service()

@service.endpoint(route="/", method="POST")
def my_endpoint(request: Request):
    ...
```

### Other Response Types

We also offer additional response types that can be used to return different types other than JSON.
These can all be found in the `buildflow.responses` module.

<Note>
    These responses are all proxies for different [starlette.responses](https://www.starlette.io/responses/) objects, and can be used interchangeably.
</Note>

| Response Type         | Description                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **FileResponse**      | Return a file from disk. Proxy for [starlette.responses.FileResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#fileresponse).                  |
| **HTMLResponse**      | Return an HTML file. Proxy for [starlette.responses.HTMLResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#htmlresponse).
| **JSONResponse**      | Return a JSON response. Proxy for [starlette.responses.JSONResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#jsonresponse).                       |
| **PlainTextResponse** | Return a plain text response. Proxy for [starlette.responses.PlainTextResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#plaintextresponse). |
| **RedirectResponse**  | Return a redirect. Proxy for [starlette.responses.RedirectResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#redirectresponse).|
| **StreamingResponse** | Returns a streaming response. Proxy for [starlette.responses.StreamingResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#streamingresponse).|

## Open API Docs

BuildFlow also automatically provides open API docs for your serivces. You can access these at the `/docs` endpoint.

## Service Options

Services can be individually configured for different resource requirements.

The following options are available:
| Option                                        | Description                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **service_id**                                | A unique ID for your service. Defaults to a random UUID.                  |
| **base_route**                                | Base route for all endpoints in the service. Defaults to `/`. This must be unique for all services in a flow.
| **num_cpus**                                  | How many CPUs should be allocated to the processor. This can be any floating point number > 0. Defaults to 1.                       |
| **log_level**                                 | Log level for the processor. Defaults to `logging.INFO`. |
| **num_replicas**                              | Number of replicas the consumer should start with. Defaults to `1`|
| **min_replicas**                              | Minimum number of replicas the consumer should have. Defaults to `1` |
| **max_replicas**                              | Maximum number of replicas the consumer should have. Defaults to `1` |
| **target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica**   | Target number of ongoing requests per replica before scaling. Setting this lower will mean replicas are added faster, setting it higher will mean replicas are added slower. Defaults to `80` |

### Example

```python
from buildflow import Flow
from buildflow.requests import Request

app = Flow()
service = app.service(num_cpus=2)

@service.endpoint(route="/", method="POST")
def my_endpoint(request: Request):
    ...
```

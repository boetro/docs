```python
app = Flow()

# Serve traffic over HTTP or Websockets
service = app.service("my-service")
@service.endpoint("/", method="GET")
def get():
  # TODO(developer): Add your logic here
  return "Hello World"

# Create event-driven workflows and background tasks
@app.consumer(
  source=SQSQueue("my-queue"),
  sink=SnowflakeTable("output-table"),
  num_concurrency=10,
)
def process(element: Dict[str, Any]):
  # TODO(developer): Add your logic here
  return element

# Collect data over HTTP
@app.collector(
  "/collect",
  method="POST",
  sink=BigQueryTable("output-table"),
)
def collect(request: Dict[str, Any]):
  # TODO(developer): Add your logic here
  return element

## What is BuildFlow?

**BuildFlow** is a Python framework that enables you to build your entire backend application.
BuildFlow's specialized decorator patterns can transform any Python function into a reliable component of your backend, allowing you to
**serve data over HTTP**, **transform data and dump to a datastore**, or **process data asynchronously from a message queues**.

All of these patterns include **automatic scaling**, **dependency injection**, and **infrastructure state management**. This means you can focus on writing your application logic and not worry about infrastructure or configuration.

Simply install BuildFlow to get started:

```
pip install buildflow
```

## Main Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="microchip" title="Common serving and processing patterns">
    **BuildFlow** offers simple decorator patterns that allow you to turn any function into a reliable component of your backend.
    - **endpoints**: Receive and respond to HTTP requests and Websocket connections
    - **collectors**: Receive HTTP requests, process them, and dump them to a data store
    - **consumers**: Process data from message queues such as Pub/Sub and Kafka

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="road-bridge" title="Infrastructure From Code">
    **BuildFlow** manages its own infrastructure and configuration, allowing you to create, manage, and connect to your cloud resources using pure Python. No more manual configuration, terraform, or separate configuration management system. Simply let your logic manage your infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="books" title="Production Ready IO Connectors">
    Use any of our existing **BuildFlow** primitives to connect to any resource in any cloud. Includes AWS, GCP, Snowflake, and DuckDB 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line-up" title="Scalable by Default">
    **BuildFlow** will automatically scale to whatever your current demands are. This ensures your application can handle any surge in traffic while still be cost effective during low traffic periods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="syringe" title="Dependency Injection">
    **BuildFlow** allows you to define custom dependencies for your processor that can be injected whenever your processor is called. This enable you to easily integrate other components into your processor, such as loading models, handling auth, or connecting to a database.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="person-running-fast" title="Async Runtime">
    **BuildFlow** runs in an asyncrounous Ray runtime allowing you to easily scale out parallel tasks with Ray or any other async framework.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="LaunchFlow">
    You can use [LaunchFlow](https://launchflow.com) to automatically deploy and manage your BuildFlow applications from VS Code or the command line.

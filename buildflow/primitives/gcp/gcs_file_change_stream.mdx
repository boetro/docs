title: 'GCS File Change Stream'
---


GCSFileChangeStream is a source primitive that can be used to subscribe to file changes on a given GCS bucket. To create a GCSFileChangeStream provide:
| Arg            | Description                                                                                                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **gcs_bucket** | [ GCSBucket ]( /primitives/gcp/gcs )  to subscribe to change events from. NOTE: you do not need to provide file path or file format. |
| event_types    | List of event types to subscribe to. Defaults to:  ` [GCSChangeStreamEventType.OBJECT_FINALIZE] `                            |


<Tip>
    You must mark your GCSFileChangeStream primitive as managed to have the underlying infrastructure created.
</Tip>

```python

from buildflow.io.gcp import GCSBucket, GCSFileChangeStream
from buildflow.types.gcp import GCSFileChangeEvent

bucket = GCSBucket("project", bucket_name="my-bucket")
source = GCSFileChangeStream(gcs_bucket=bucket)

app.manage(bucket, source)

@app.consumer(source=source, sink=...)
def my_consumer(elem: GCSFileChangeEvent):
    ...
```

With event types:

```python
from buildflow.io.gcp import GCSBucket, GCSFileChangeStream
from buildflow.types.gcp import GCSFileChangeEvent, GCSChangeStreamEventType

bucket = GCSBucket("project", bucket_name="my-bucket")
source = GCSFileChangeStream(
    gcs_bucket=bucket,
    event_types=[GCSChangeStreamEventType.OBJECT_FINALIZE, GCSChangeStreamEventType.OBJECT_DELETE],
)

app.manage(bucket, source)

@app.consumer(source=source, sink=...)
def my_consumer(elem: GCSFileChangeEvent):
    ...
```

## Types

The GCSFileChangeStream source always returns a `GCSFileChangeEvent` object. This object contains the following fields:

| Field      | Description                                                                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| event_type | The `buildflow.types.gcp.GCSChangeStreamEventType` event type                                  |
| metadata   | Any metadata that was associated with the file change event. This is a dictionary of strings. |
| blob       | The raw contents of the file. This is lazily fetched.                                         |


## Resource Creation

If you are using BuildFlow's built in resource creation/management you can use the GCSFileChangeStream primitive type to create and manage all resources that are need to subscribe to a GCS bucket.

The following resources will be created:
- GCP PubSub Topic
- GCP PubSub Subscription
- GCP Bucket Notification
- GCS Bucket
- IAM permissions for GCS service account

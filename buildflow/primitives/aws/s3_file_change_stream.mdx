title: 'S3 File Change Stream'
---

S3FileChangeStream is a source primitive that can be used to subscribe to file changes on a given S3 bucket. To create a S3FileChangeStream provide:

| Arg           | Description                                                                                                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **s3_bucket** | [ S3Bucket ](/buildflow/primitives/aws/s3)  to subscribe to change events from. NOTE: you do not need to provide file path or file format. |
| event_types   | List of event types to subscribe to. Defaults to:  ` [S3ChangeStreamEventType.OBJECT_CREATED_ALL] `                |


<Tip>
    You must mark your S3FileChangeStream primitive as managed to have the underlying infrastructure created.
</Tip>


```python

from buildflow.io.aws import S3Bucket, S3FileChangeStream
from buildflow.types.aws import S3FileChangeEvent

bucket = S3Bucket(bucket_name="my-bucket")
source = S3FileChangeStream(s3_bucket=bucket)

app.manage(bucket, source)

@app.consumer(source=source, sink=...)
def consumer(elem: S3FileChangeEvent):
    ...
```

With event types:

```python
from buildflow.io.aws import S3Bucket, S3FileChangeStream
from buildflow.types.aws import S3FileChangeEvent, S3ChangeStreamEventType

bucket = S3Bucket(bucket_name="my-bucket")
source = S3FileChangeStream(
    s3_bucket=bucket,
    event_types=[S3ChangeStreamEventType.OBJECT_CREATED_ALL, S3ChangeStreamEventType.OBJECT_REMOVED_ALL])

app.manage(bucket, source)

@app.consumer(source=source, sink=...)
def consumer(elem: S3FileChangeEvent):
    ...
```

## Types

The S3FileChangeStream source always returns a `S3FileChangeEvent` object. This object contains the following fields:

| Field      | Description                                                                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| event_type | The `buildflow.types.aws.S3ChangeStreamEventType` event type                                  |
| metadata   | Any metadata that was associated with the file change event. This is a dictionary of strings. |
| blob       | The raw contents of the file. This is lazily fetched.                                         |

## Resource Creation

If you are using BuildFlow's built in resource creation/management you can use the S3FileChangeStream primitive type to create and manage all resources that are need to subscribe to a S3 bucket.

The following resources will be created:
- S3 Bucket
- SQS Queue
- S3 Bucket Notification
- SQS Queue Policy

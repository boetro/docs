title: "Load and Serve a Model"
---

In this guide we will go over how to load and serve a model that is stored in a remote bucket (GCS or S3). We will load the model at server startup and ensure that it gets used across requests.
All the code for this guide can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-samples/tree/main/google-auth).


To do this we will use:

- [endpoints](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) to serve the model
- [A custom dependency](/buildflow/programming-guide/dependencies) to load the model from a remote bucket

To see a full working application example with a UI included see our [Llama2 AI chat example](/buildflow/examples/llama2-ai-chatbot).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Initialize Flow">
        First we create a new BuildFlow [Flow](/buildflow/programming-guide/flows). This will be the main entry point to our application.

        ```python
        app = Flow()
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Attach a Service">
        We then attach a service to our flow object. We will later attach endpoints that can be called by the user.

        ```python
        service = app.service(service_id="model-loading")
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Define our Bucket Primtive">
        Next we define a [primitive](/buildflow/programming-guide/primitives) to reference the bucket where our model is stored, and create a [dependency](/buildflow/programming-guide/dependencies) to open a connection to that [bucket](/buildflow/dependencies/bucket).

        ```python
        bucket = S3Bucket(bucket_name="launchflow-llama-models")
        ModelBucketDep = BucketDependencyBuilder(bucket)
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create our Custom Model Dependency">

        Now we  define our custom [dependency](/buildflow/programming-guide/dependencies) to download our model from the bucket and store it locally. This dependency consumes the bucket dependency we created in the previous step to get a connect to the bucket.
        We create the dependency by annotating our class with `@dependency(scope=Scope.REPLICA)` this marks the class as a dependency that can be injected into any [processor](/buildflow/programming-guide/processors) and only one instance of 
        the dependency should be created per [replica](/buildflow/concepts#replicas).

        <Note>
            We use `asyncio.Lock` to ensure our model is only called by one request at a time. This is because the model engine we're using ([llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)) does not support batching.
        </Note>

        ```python
        @dependency(scope=Scope.REPLICA)
        class ModelDep:
            def __init__(self, bucket_dep: ModelBucketDep):
                full_path = os.path.abspath("llama-2-7b-chat.Q8_0.gguf")
                if not os.path.exists(full_path):
                    logging.info("Downloading model from S3")
                    bucket_dep.bucket.download_file("llama-2-7b-chat.Q8_0.gguf", full_path)
                self._llama_model = Llama(full_path, verbose=False)
                self._lock = Lock()

            async def model(self):
                await self._lock.acquire()
                return self._llama_model

            def release(self):
                self._lock.release()
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Call our Model">
        Now that we have loaded our model lets call it from an [endpoint](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints)! We can do this by attaching the `@service.endpoint` decorator to a function that consumes a string prompt and our `ModelDep` dependency.
        We then pass in the string prompt to the model and return the result.

        <Tip>
            We use a `StreamingResponse` to allow results to be streamed back to the user as they become available.
        </Tip>

        ```python
        @service.endpoint(route="/chat", method="POST")
        async def chat(
            prompt: str,
            model_dep: ModelDep,
        ) -> StreamingResponse:
            llama_chat_messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

            model = await model_dep.model()
            try:
                chat_prediction = model.create_chat_completion(llama_chat_messages, stream=True)
            except Exception as e:
                model_dep.release()
                raise e

            def iter_chunks():
                try:
                    for chunk in chat_prediction:
                        if chunk.get("choices", []):
                            choice = chunk["choices"][0]
                            message_chunk = choice.get("delta", {}).get("content", "")
                            yield message_chunk
                finally:
                    model_dep.release()

            return StreamingResponse(iter_chunks())
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the Code">
        You can run this guide locally with the VS Code extension or by running `buildflow run` in the applications root directory.

        Once running you can navigate to http://localhost:8000 to see the swagger UI and test out the endpoint.

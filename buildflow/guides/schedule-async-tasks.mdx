title: "Schedule Async Tasks"
---

In this guide we will go over how to schedule async tasks in your application. This specific example will simulate a dead letter queue, where we schedule failed work on a queue for reliable processing.

All the code for this guide can be found on GitHub:
- [Scheduling Tasks on AWS SQS](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-templates/tree/main/samples/dead-letter-queue-sqs).
- [Scheduling Tasks on GCP Pub/Sub](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-templates/tree/main/samples/dead-letter-queue-pubsub).

<Note>
    The code below uses GCP Pub/Sub but the only difference is the primitives that are used.
</Note>


To do this we will use:
- an [endpoint](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) receive requests from user
- queue [primitives](/buildflow/programming-guide/primitives) to schedule tasks on a queue for GCP we will use [Pub/Sub](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/pubsub) and for AWS we will use [SQS](/buildflow/primitives/aws/sqs)
- a [sink dependency](/buildflow/dependencies/sink) to push data to our queue
- a [consumer](/buildflow/programming-guide/consumers) for processing data pushed to the queue

To see a full working applications example with a UI included see our [Image Classification example](/buildflow/examples/image-classification).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Define our Resources">
    First we define our queue primitives. This will be the dead letter queue we send failed tasks to.
    ```python
    # TODO(developer): Set this to your GCP project ID
    GCP_PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"

    # The topic is where the messages are published.
    dlq_topic = GCPPubSubTopic(
        project_id=GCP_PROJECT_ID,
        topic_name="dead-letter-queue-topic",
    )
    # The subscription is where the messages are received.
    dlq_subscription = GCPPubSubSubscription(
        project_id=GCP_PROJECT_ID,
        subscription_name="dead-letter-queue-subscription",
    ).options(topic=dlq_topic, batch_size=1, enable_exactly_once_delivery=True)
    ```

    </Step>
    <Step title="Initialize Flow">
        Next we create a new BuildFlow [Flow](/buildflow/programming-guide/flows). This will be the main entry point to our application, and we mark our infrastructure as managed allowing it be created by `buildflow apply`

        ```python
        app = Flow()

        # Infrastructure state is managed by BuildFlow.
        app.manage(dlq_topic, dlq_subscription)
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Attach our Dead Letter Queue Consumer">
        Now we attach a consumer to our application. This consumer has a source that is our dead letter queue subscription. Meaning it will receive any messages that are pushed to the queue.

        ```python
        @app.consumer(source=dlq_subscription)
        def handle_errors(payload: FailedPayload):
            # TODO: Handle the error.
            print(f"Received error: {payload.message}")
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Attach a Service">
        We then attach a service to our flow object. We will later attach an endpoint for receiving data.

        ```python
        # This is an example service that uses the dead letter queue.
        service = app.service(service_id="service-id")
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a Sink Dependency">
        Now we create a [sink dependency](/buildflow/dependencies/sink) to push data to our queue.

        ```python
        # This dependency builder lets us inject a sink that can be used to push data to
        # the dead letter queue.
        DLQ = SinkDependencyBuilder(dlq_topic)
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Attach Endpoint for Receiving Data">
        Next we attach an [endpoint](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) to our service to receive data from the user.

        This endpoint takes in one argument.
        1. The sink dependency we defined in the previous step. BuildFlow will automatically inject this when you receive requests.

        This endpoint will randomly fail every other request to simulate a flakey service. We then call `dlq.push` to push a JSON object to our dead letter queue if an exception is thrown.

        <Tip>
            Notice that `dlq.push` is an async method so we must use `await` to call it, and we mark our endpoint processor as async by using `async def`.
        </Tip>

        ```python
        @service.endpoint("/", "GET")
        async def some_endpoint(dlq: DLQ):
            try:
                # Simulate an error.
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    raise Exception("Something went wrong!")
                return "Success!"
            except Exception as e:
                await dlq.push(FailedPayload(message=str(e)))
                return "Failure!"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the Code">
        <Tip>
            If you're using GCP ensure you set the environment variable `GCP_PROJECT_ID` before running any of the below commands.
        </Tip>

        First create all the resources with the VS Code extension or the CLI:

        ```
        buildflow apply
        ```

        Once completed you can run the code with the VS Code extension or the CLI:

        ```
        buildflow run
        ```

        Now you can visit: http://localhost:8000/docs to see the swagger UI to send a request and watch it be enqueue and be processed by your consumer.

    </Step>

<div className="grid sm:grid-cols-2">
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>From the `Apps` tab click `Create from Template`</li>
            <li>Click `Google Auth`</li>
            <li>Select a directory to save the project</li>
            <li>This will download the template and add it to your workspace</li>
        </ol>
        <Tip>
            You will now see the `dead-letter-queue` app on the `Apps` tab.

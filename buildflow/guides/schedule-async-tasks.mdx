title: "Schedule Async Tasks"
---

In this guide we will go over how to schedule async tasks in your application.
All the code for this guide can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow-samples/tree/main/schedule-async-tasks).


To do this we will use:
- an [endpoint](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) receive requests from user
- queue [primitives](/buildflow/programming-guide/primitives) to schedule tasks on a queue for GCP we will use [Pub/Sub](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/pubsub) and for AWS we will use [SQS](/buildflow/primitives/aws/sqs)
- a [sink dependency](/buildflow/dependencies/sink) to push data to our queue
- a [consumer](/buildflow/programming-guide/consumers) for processing data pushed to the queue

To see a full working applications example with a UI included see our [Image Classification example](/buildflow/examples/image-classification).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Initialize Flow">
        First we create a new BuildFlow [Flow](/buildflow/programming-guide/flows). This will be the main entry point to our application.

        ```python
        app = Flow()
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Attach a Service">
        We then attach a service to our flow object. We will later attach an endpoint for receiving data.

        ```python
        service = app.service(service_id="schedule-async-tasks")
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Define Queue Primitives">

        Next we define [primitives](/buildflow/programming-guide/primitives) to enque data for async tasks, and mark them as managed by BuildFlow.

        - For GCP we use a [Pub/Sub topic](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/pubsub#gcp-pub-sub-topic) and [Pub/Sub subscription](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/pubsub#gcp-pub-sub-subscription)
        - For AWS we use a [SQS queue](/buildflow/primitives/aws/sqs)

        <Tip>
            If you would like to use AWS simply comment out the GCP lines, and uncomment the AWS lines.
        </Tip>

        ```python
        gcp_pubsub_topic = GCPPubSubTopic(
            project_id=os.environ["GCP_PROJECT_ID"], topic_name="sample-topic"
        )
        gcp_pubsub_subscription = GCPPubSubSubscription(
            project_id=os.environ["GCP_PROJECT_ID"],
            subscription_name="sample-subscription",
        ).options(topic=gcp_pubsub_topic)

        # sqs_queue = SQSQueue(queue_name="sample-queue")

        app.manage(gcp_pubsub_topic, gcp_pubsub_subscription)
        # app.manage(sqs_queue)
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a Sink Dependency">
        Now we create a [sink dependency](/buildflow/dependencies/sink) to push data to our queue.

        <Tip>
            Swap the comments on these lines if you are using AWS.
        </Tip>


        ```python
        Sink = SinkDependencyBuilder(gcp_pubsub_topic)
        # Sink = SinkDependencyBuilder(sqs_queue)
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Attach Endpoint for Receiving Data">
        Next we attach an [endpoint](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) to our service to receive data from the user.

        This endpoint takes in two arguments.
        1. The number provided by the user
        2. The sink we defined in the previous step

        We then call `sink.push` to push a JSON object to our queue.

        <Tip>
            Notice that `sink.push` is an async method so we must use `await` to call it, and we mark our endpoint processor as async by using `async def`.
        </Tip>

        ```python
        @service.endpoint("/square", method="GET")
        async def square_endpoint(num: int, sink: Sink):
            await sink.push({"num": num})
            return {"success": True}
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Consume the Queue">
        Finally we consume the data that was put on the queue using a [consumer](/buildflow/programming-guide/consumers).

        <Tip>
            Swap the comments on these lines if you are using AWS.
        </Tip>

        ```python
        # @app.consumer(source=sqs_queue)
        @app.consumer(source=gcp_pubsub_subscription)
        def square_consumer(element: Dict[str, int]):
            square = element["num"] * element["num"]
            print(f"square of: {element['num']} is {square}")
        ```

        All this consumer does is print the square of the number that was pushed to the queue. You could optional add a `sink` to allow the consumer to push data to another primitive.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the Code">
        <Tip>
            If you're using GCP ensure you set the environment variable `GCP_PROJECT_ID` before running any of the below commands.
        </Tip>

        First create all the resources with the VSCode extension or the CLI:

        ```bash
        buildflow apply
        ```

        Once completed you can run the code with the VSCode extension or the CLI:

        ```bash
        buildflow run
        ```

        Now you can visit: http://localhost:8000/docs to see the swagger UI to send a request and watch it be enqueue and processed by your consumer.

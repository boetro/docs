In this example we will be creating a simple CRUD API that allows users to log in with their Google account and create and update journal entries. These entries will be stored in a Postgres database hosted on GCP and will be accessible to the user when they log in.

Our API will be built using [endpoints](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) and our databased will be hosted on [Google Cloud SQL](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/cloud_sql) that we connect to via [SQLAlchemy](/buildflow/dependencies/sqlalchemy).


Before completing the example ensure you have [installed BuildFlow](/buildflow/programming-guide/install)
with all [extra dependencies](/buildflow/programming-guide/install#extra-dependencies).


To run this example on resources created on GCP use [this github repo](https://github.com/launchflow/gcp-saas-example).
<Note>    
    In order to run this code you will need to have a GCP project created that you have access to.

    Follow the [Google Cloud Walkthrough](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) to create a new one if you need to.
</Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone the GitHub Repo">
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:launchflow/gcp-saas-example.git
    cd gcp-saas-example
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install your requirements">
        ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a .env file">
        Rename the `template.env` to `.env` and update all variables

<Tip>
    You will need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials to fill out these variables: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#1.-obtain-oauth-2.0-credentials-from-the-dynamic_data.setvar.console_name-.

    Or you can use one you already have in place if you want.
</Tip>

| Variable          | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GCP_PROJECT_ID    | The GCP Project where your resources (Cloud SQL instance and database) should be created.                                                                                                 |
| DATABASE_USER     | The user used for authenticating with your database (defaults to `postgres`) this will be set in GCP in a later step. |
| DATABASE_PASSWORD | The password of the user for authenticating with your database this will be set in GCP in a later step.                                                                                                                           |
| CLIENT_ID         | OAuth client ID obtained from google.                                                                                                                                                     |
| CLIENT_SECRET     | OAuth client secret obtained from google.                                                                                                                                                 |

        
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your resources">
        Create all the resources that are required for your system.
        ```
            buildflow apply
        ```
        <Tip>
            Make sure you have logged in with GCP with: `gcloud auth login --update-adc`
        </Tip>

        This will output every primitive that will be created, and ask you to confirm before creating them:

        ```
Primitives to create:
---------------------
├── CloudSQLInstance
│   └── <GCP_PROJECT_ID>:launchflow-gcp-postgres-auth-cloud-sql
└── CloudSQLDatabase
    └── <GCP_PROJECT_ID>:launchflow-gcp-postgres-auth-cloud-sql.launchflow-gcp-postgres-auth-cloud-db


Would you like to apply these changes?
Enter "y (yes)" to confirm, "n (no) to reject":
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your database user">
         A user and password can be added following this [guide](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-manage-users). Ensure this matches with what you put in your `.env` file.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update your OAuth Credentials">
    For your [OAuth credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/javascript-implicit-flow#creatingcred) update the **Authorized JavaScript origins** and **Authorized redirect URIs** to match your local environment.

    For **Authorized JavaScript origins** you will need to add http://localhost:8000 and for **Authorized redirect URIs** you will need to add http://localhost:3001/auth/callback/google
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run your project">
        Update the `.env` to set `CREATE_MODELS=true` this will create all the necessary databases when you run your project.

        Run your project with:

        ```
            buildflow run
        ```

        Once running you can visit http://localhost:8000 to begin using your app.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Cleanup your resources">
        Once you're finished with your app, you can easily delete all of your resources with one command.

        ```
            buildflow destroy
        ```
    </Step>

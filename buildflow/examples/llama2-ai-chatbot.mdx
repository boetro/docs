---

In this example we will create a chatbot that uses the Llama2 7b chat model. This model is stored in a remote bucket (either GCS or S3) and gets downloaded and loaded when we start our application.

Our model will be served using an [endpoint](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) that loads our model via a [custom dependency](/buildflow/programming-guide/dependencies) that will be shared across requests.


Before completing the example ensure you have [installed BuildFlow](/buildflow/programming-guide/install)
with all [extra dependencies](/buildflow/programming-guide/install#extra-dependencies).

<Tip>
    Our basic model is hosted on a public bucket, but you can also host your own model on a private bucket.
</Tip>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone the GitHub Repo">
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:launchflow/launchflow-model-serving.git
    cd launchflow-model-serving
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install your requirements">
        ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run your project">
        Run your project with:

        ```
            buildflow run
        ```

        <Tip>
            If you want to experiment loading the model from S3 instead of GCS simply set `USE_GCP=false` in the `.env` file
        </Tip>

        Once running you can visit http://localhost:8000 to begin chatting with the AI!
    </Step>
    <Step title="What's next?">
        Now that you have a working chatbot, you can start to customize it to your needs. Such as adding [google auth](/buildflow/dependencies/auth#authenticated-google-user) for user authentication or a [postgres database](/buildflow/dependencies/sqlalchemy) for permanent storage. Or even hosting your own model on a private bucket.

        See our [SaaS example](/buildflow/examples/saas) for an example of how to add these features.

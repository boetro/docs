## Install buildflow

```bash
pip install buildflow
```

<Tip>
    [LaunchFlow](https://launchflow.com) offers a [free VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LaunchFlow.launchflow) that can help you get started even quicker!

## Create a new project

Once installed you will now have access to the `buildflow` CLI tool. First create a directory for your application and then run the `init` command which will prompt you to enter a project name.

```bash
mkdir my-project-dir
cd my-project-dir
buildflow init
```

The `init` command creates a basic structure for your application. You are of course free to change this in any way you like.


If you want to just get started quickly you can run start your application with:

```
buildflow run
```

Then you can visit http://localhost:8000 to see your application running.

### Directory Structure

At the root level there are three important files:

- `buildflow.yml` - This is the main configuration file for your appliction. It contains all the information about your application and how it should be built.
- `main.py` - This is the entry point to your application and where your `Flow` is initialized.
- `requirements.txt` - This is where you can specify any Python dependencies your application has.

Below the root level we have:

**Project Code Directory**

This is the directory where your application code lives. It will match the name of your application. You can put any files you want in here and they will be available to your application. We create a couple directories for you:

- **processors**: This is where you can put any custom processors you want to use in your application. In here you will see we have defined a *service.py* for a service in your application and a *hello_world.py* file for a custom endpoint processor.
- **resources**: This is where you can define any custom primitive resources that your application will need. Note it is empty right now since your initial project is so simple.

**.buildflow**

This is a hidden directory that contains all the build artifacts for your application. You can general ignore this directory and it will be automatically generated for you. If you are using github you probably want to put this in your *.gitignore* file.

## Running your application

Simply run:

```
buildflow run
```

Then you can visit http://localhost:8000 to see your application running.

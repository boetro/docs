description: 'Upload images to a bucket and then run them through an image classification model.'

In this guide we'll introduce you to BuildFlow and BuildFlow concepts by writing a simple image classification application.

Our application will:
1. Expose and endpoint that allows users to upload images
2. When our endpoint receives an image, it will upload the image to a bucket (GCS or S3)
3. When the image is uploaded it will trigger a notification on our queue (GCP Pub/Sub or AWS SQS)
4. Our consumer will receive this notification and run the image through an image classification model
5. The results of the image classification will be stored in a data warehouse (BigQuery or DuckDB)
6. The data warehouse will be exposed by another endpoint

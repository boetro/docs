The **Endpoint** pattern enables serving HTTP traffic via an API. 

An endpoint is composed of:
- A `route`: this is the path that the endpoint will be available at.
- A `method`: this is the method that the endpoint will be available at currently `GET`, `POST`, and `WEBSOCKET` are supported.
- Your processing Logic.

Endpoints are created as part of a `Service`. A Service is a collection of endpoints that all share the same set of resources.

A service can be created by calling `app.service()`. This will create a service that is automatically attached to the flow.

```python
from buildflow import Flow

app = Flow()
service = app.service()
```

You can also manually create a service and attach it with `app.add_service(service)`

```python
from buildflow import Flow, Service

app = Flow()
service = Service()
app.add_service(service)
```

Endpoints can be attached to a service with the `@service.endpoint(...)` decorator.

```python
from buildflow import Flow

app = Flow()
service = app.service()

@service.endpoint(route="/", method="POST")
def my_endpoint(...):
    ...
```

Or by calling `service.add_endpoint(...)` and using the `@endpoint` decorator.

```python
from buildflow import Flow, endpoint

app = Flow()
service = app.service()

@endpoint(route="/", method="POST")
def my_endpoint(...):
    ...
service.add_endpoint(my_endpoint)
```

## Request and Response Type

### JSON Request Body and Response

The input of your collector will be one request from your HTTP endpoint.
If you endpoint is processing a JSON payload you can specify a dataclass type, and the JSON will be automatically deserialized into that type.
Similar for responses, if you return a dataclass it will be serialized to JSON.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from buildflow import Flow

@dataclass
class MyType:
    val: int

app = Flow()
service = app.service()

@service.endpoint(route="/", method="POST")
def my_endpoint(request: MyType) -> MyType:
    return request
```

### Query parameters

With endpoints you can also define query parameters. The query is the key-value pairs that go after the `?` in the URL.

```python
from buildflow import Flow

service = app.service()

@service.endpoint(route="/my_endpoint", method="GET")
def my_endpoint(my_int: int) -> int:
    return request
```

Requests to this URL would look like:

```
http://localhost/my_endpoint?my_int=1
```

### Raw Request

If you need access to the entire request you can also import `from buildflow.requests import Request`. If you do this no validation will be performed but you will have access to all the request data.

<Note>
    `buildflow.requests.Request` is just a proxy for the [starlette.requests.Request](https://www.starlette.io/requests/) object.

    We simply provide it as a convenience to avoid having to import `starlette.requests.Request` directly.
</Note>

```python
from buildflow import Flow
from buildflow.requests import Request

app = Flow()
service = app.service()

@service.endpoint(route="/", method="POST")
def my_endpoint(request: Request):
    ...
```

### Other Request Types

We also offer additional request types that can be used to receive different types other than JSON. Such as form data or files. These are available in the `buildflow.requests` module. 

<Note>
    Note these are just proxy imports for FastAPI and Starlette request types for convenience. You can find more details on these in the [FastAPI docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-forms/) and [Starlette docs](https://www.starlette.io/requests/).
</Note>

| Request Type         | Description                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Form**      | Process a form from an http body. Proxy for [fastapi.Form](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-forms/).                  |
| **UploadFile**      | Process a file from an http request. Proxy for [fastapi.UploadFile](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-files/#file-parameters-with-uploadfile).
| **WebSocket**      | Process a websocket request. Proxy for [starlette.websockets.WebSocket](https://www.starlette.io/websockets/).


### Other Response Types

We also offer additional response types that can be used to return different types other than JSON.
These can all be found in the `buildflow.responses` module.

<Note>
    These responses are all proxies for different [starlette.responses](https://www.starlette.io/responses/) objects, and can be used interchangeably.
</Note>

| Response Type         | Description                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **FileResponse**      | Return a file from disk. Proxy for [starlette.responses.FileResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#fileresponse).                  |
| **HTMLResponse**      | Return an HTML file. Proxy for [starlette.responses.HTMLResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#htmlresponse).
| **JSONResponse**      | Return a JSON response. Proxy for [starlette.responses.JSONResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#jsonresponse).                       |
| **PlainTextResponse** | Return a plain text response. Proxy for [starlette.responses.PlainTextResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#plaintextresponse). |
| **RedirectResponse**  | Return a redirect. Proxy for [starlette.responses.RedirectResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#redirectresponse).|
| **StreamingResponse** | Returns a streaming response. Proxy for [starlette.responses.StreamingResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#streamingresponse).|


## WebSockets

WebSockets are full supported inside of a service. To use a websocket endpoint simply set the `method` to `WEBSOCKET`. Your endpoint will take in a `buildflow.requests.WebSocket` object that can be used to communicated with the client.

```python
from buildflow import endpoint
from buildflow.requests import WebSocket

@endpoint("/websocket-endpoint", method="websocket")
async def tail_logs(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    while True:
        data = await websocket.receive_text()
        await websocket.send_text(f"Message text was: {data}")
```

## Middleware

You can attach middle ware to your service using the `add_middleware` method on your service. You can use any middleware provided by [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/middleware/). We also provide some convenience imports at `buildflow.middleware`.

### CORS middleware

For additional details see the starlette [CORS middleware](https://www.starlette.io/middleware/#corsmiddleware).


```python
from buildflow import Service
from buildflow.middleware import CORSMiddleware

service = Service()
service.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```


### SessionMiddleware

For additional details see the starlette [SessionMiddleware](https://www.starlette.io/middleware/#sessionmiddleware).

```python
from buildflow import Service
from buildflow.middleware import SessionMiddleware

service = Service()
service.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=session_secret)
```

## Open API Docs

BuildFlow also automatically provides open API docs for your serivces. You can access these at the `/docs` endpoint.

## Service Options

Services can be individually configured for different resource requirements.

The following options are available:
| Option                                        | Description                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **service_id**                                | A unique ID for your service. Defaults to a random UUID.                  |
| **base_route**                                | Base route for all endpoints in the service. Defaults to `/`. This must be unique for all services in a flow.
| **num_cpus**                                  | How many CPUs should be allocated to the processor. This can be any floating point number > 0. Defaults to `1`.                       |
| **log_level**                                 | Log level for the processor. Defaults to `logging.INFO`. |
| **num_replicas**                              | Number of replicas the consumer should start with. Defaults to `1`|
| **min_replicas**                              | Minimum number of replicas the consumer should have. Defaults to `1` |
| **max_replicas**                              | Maximum number of replicas the consumer should have. Defaults to `1` |
| **max_concurrent_queries**                    | Maximum number of queries that are sent to a replica without receving a response. Defaults to `100` |
| **target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica**   | Target number of ongoing requests per replica before scaling. Setting this lower will mean replicas are added faster, setting it higher will mean replicas are added slower. Defaults to `1` |


### Example

```python
from buildflow import Flow
from buildflow.requests import Request

app = Flow()
service = app.service(num_cpus=2)

@service.endpoint(route="/", method="POST")
def my_endpoint(request: Request):
    ...
```

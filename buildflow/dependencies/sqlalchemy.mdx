BuildFlow offers a SessionDep that be used to create a SQLAlchemy session connected to a database primitive.
This session can then be used to query the database.
Each session returned by the dependency will be created from a connection that is shared across all processors replicas. To create a SessionDep you must provide the following fields:

| Arg             | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **db_primitive** | The database prmitive we should connect to. Currently we only support [CloudSQLDatabase](/buildflow/primitives/gcp/cloud_sql#cloud-sql-database)                                                                                                                                                   |
| **db_user**   | The user name to use for authenticating with the database |
| **db_password** | The password to use for connecting to the database                                                                                                     |

The SessionDep returns an object with one field `session` which is a session connected to your dependency. This object is scoped to your processor so you will get a new session every time your processor is called.

Example usage:

```python
from buildflow.dependencies.sqlalchemy import SessionDep
from buildflow.io.gcp import CloudSQLDatabase

cloud_sql_database = CloudSQLDatabase(...)


DB = SessionDep(
    db_primitive=cloud_sql_database, db_user="user", db_password="password"
)

@app.endpoint("/", method="POST")
def endpoint(dep: DB):
    with dep.session as session:
        session.query(...)
```

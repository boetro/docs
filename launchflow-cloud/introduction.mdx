## What is LaunchFlow Cloud?

LaunchFlow Cloud is a serverless platform allowing you to deploy your [BuildFlow](/buildflow) app with the click of a button.


### Main Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line-up" title="Effortless Autoscaling">
    LaunchFlow will spin up and tear down new machines as needed. This means your system will automatically scale to whatever your current demands are. This ensures your system can handle any surge in traffic while still be cost effective during low traffic periods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="dollar-sign" title="Pay for What You Use">
    Autoscaling combined with our usage based pricing means you only pay for what you use. No more paying for idle resources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="Monitoring Best Practices">
    LaunchFlow automatically exports your logs and metrics to remote storage, meaning you can always see what is happening inside your system.    
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="arrows-rotate" title="Zero Downtime Updates">
    Rollout changes with confidence that your users will experience zero down time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pure Python" icon="snake">
    All you need to do is write python code, never touch a docker image again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="files" title="Configured by Default">

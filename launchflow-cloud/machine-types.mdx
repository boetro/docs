title: Machine Types
---

No matter what type of machine you use your billing rate will always be the same ($0.12 per CPU hour). The only difference is the amount of resources you have access to. The following table shows the different types of machines available on the cluster.

<table style={{ display: "inline-table", width: "100%"}} >
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>CPUs</th>
         <th>RAM (GB)</th>
         <th>Hourly Cost</th>
         <th>Monthly Cost</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>2</td>
         <td>7.5</td>
         <td>\$0.24</td>
         <td>\$175.2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>4</td>
         <td>15</td>
         <td>\$0.48</td>
         <td>\$350.4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>16</td>
         <td>60</td>
         <td>\$1.92</td>

Machine types can be specified in two ways:

1. Configuring the machine information in an [environment](/launchflow-cloud/user-guides/environments) and launching a deployment to the environment.

<Tip>
   Once you configure the machine information in an environment, all deployments launched in the environment will use the machine information.
</Tip>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VS Code Extension">
   TODO: add extension
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ```
      launch environments update --num-cpus=8 --name=dev
      launch deploy --environment=dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. When you launch a deployment via the CLI; if no machine type is specific the default is 2 CPUs and 7.5 GB of RAM. For example, to launch a deployment with 8 CPUs you would run the following command:

```
launch deploy --num-cpus=8
```

title: Machine Types
---

No matter what type of machine you use your billing rate will always be the same ($0.12 per CPU hour). The only difference is the amount of resources you have access to. The following table shows the different types of machines available on the cluster.

<table style={{ display: "inline-table", width: "100%"}} >
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>CPUs</th>
         <th>RAM (GB)</th>
         <th>Hourly Cost (USD)</th>
         {/* <th>Monthly Cost (USD)</th> */}
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>2</td>
         <td>7.5</td>
         <td>$0.24</td>
         {/* <td>$175.2</td> */}
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>4</td>
         <td>15</td>
         <td>$0.48</td>
         {/* <td>$350.4</td> */}
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>8</td>
         <td>30</td>
         <td>$0.96</td>
         {/* <td>$700.8</td> */}
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>16</td>
         <td>60</td>
         <td>$1.92</td>
         {/* <td>$1401.6</td> */}
      </tr>

Machine types can be specified when you launch a deployment via the CLI; if no machine type is specific the default is 2 CPUs and 7.5 GB of RAM. For example, to launch a deployment with 8 CPUs you would run the following command:

```
launch deployments submit --num-cpus=8
```

<Note>
    Specifying a machine type is not currently supported in the VS Code extension and the default of two will be used.

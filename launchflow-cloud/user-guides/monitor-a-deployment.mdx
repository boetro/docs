To view deployment metrics you can click the `Open Logs` button in the VS Code Extension or run the `launch deployments logs` command.

## Deployment metrics

Deployment metrics can be viewed in realtime in the VS Code Extension by attaching to a running deployment (this happens automatically when you launch a new deployment). Or you can use the `launch deployments ping` CLI command to view the latest metrics.

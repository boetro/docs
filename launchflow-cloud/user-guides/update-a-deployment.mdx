title: Update a Deployment
---

To update a deployment you can click the `Update Deployment` button in the VSCode extension or use the `deployments update` command in the CLI. Updating a deployment will drain a previous deployment and migrate all traffic to your new deployment. The new deployment will share the same URL as the previous deployment.

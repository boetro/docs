title: Provide your own Credentials
---

You can provide your own cloud provider credentials to Launchflow by passing them into your BuildFlow [FlowOptions](/buildflow/programming-guide/flows#credentials).
This will ensure that your deployment uses the provided credentials when making requests.

<Tip>
    This is useful if you are using [consumers](/buildflow/programming-guide/consumers) to read from sources and write to sinks.
</Tip>

```python
from buildflow import Flow, FlowOptions

app = Flow(
    flow_optoins=FlowOptions(
        gcp_service_account_info=...
        aws_access_key_id=...
        aws_secret_access_key=...
    )
)
```

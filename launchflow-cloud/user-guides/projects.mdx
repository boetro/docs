## Creating a Project

To a create a project you will need to specify a display name for the project. This name must contain only numbers, letters (lower or upper case), hypens (`-`), and be less than 64 characters.


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VS Code Extension">
    TODO
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    Use the [project create](/developer-tools/cli/reference/projects#create) command to create a project.

    ```
        launch projects create $PROJECT_DISPLAY_NAME
    ```

    Once this command finishes it will output the project ID that you can use to manage your project.

    <Tip>
        If you plan to use this as your main / default project you can run:

        ```
            launch config set-default-project $PROJECT_ID
        ```

        And all future commands will use this project by default.

title: Getting Started
---

## Install the CLI

The CLI can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install launchflow
```

<Tip>
    If you ever need help with any command you can add `--help` to print out the documentation for that command.

    Some examples:

    ```
    launch --help
    launch auth --help
    launch auth login --help
    ```
</Tip>

## Login with the CLI

To login to LaunchFlow cloud using the CLI run the following command:

```bash
launch auth login
```

This will prompt you to login in using either GitHub or Google.

<Tip>
    If you don't have an account this will create one for you.
</Tip>

## Signup For a Standard Subscription

To launch your first deployment you'll need to signup for a standard subscription.

You can do this by running:

```
launch accounts upgrade
```

This will generate a URL for you to upgrade your account.

<Tip>
    By signing up you will get a 50 dollar credit.
</Tip>

## Launch your First Deployment

To launch your first deployment simply create a [new BuildFlow project](/buildflow/reference/cli/init) using the BuildFlow CLI in a directory of your choosing:

```bash
buildflow init
```

This will create a simple HTTP serve that displays a "Hello World" message.

To launch the deployment run the following command in the same directory that you ran `buildflow init` in:

```bash
launch deployments submit
```

This will deploy your project to LaunchFlow cloud, and spit out a deployment ID and other useful commands to track the progress of the deployment.
For instance, you can track the progress using the `launch deployments ping` command:

```bash
launch deployments ping $DEPLOYMENT_ID
```

Once the deployment is running you should be able to find the URL of the HTTP server using the `launch deployments ping` command and visiting the URL in your browser:

```bash
Deployments
-----------
-   id: deployment_37019776288
    ...
    url: https://<PROJECT-NAME>-<DEPLOYMENT_ID_NUMBER>.dev.launchflow.app
    ...
```

When you're done you can drain or stop you deployment using the `launch deployments drain` or `launch deployments stop` commands respectively.
Drain will ensure all active requests complete before stopping the deployment, while stop will immediately stop the deployment.

```
launch deployments drain
```

```
launch deployment stop
```

## What's Next?

Now that you've launched your first deployment, you can follow the [BuildFlow docs](/buildflow) to add even more functionality to your project, and [update your existing deployment](/launchflow-cloud/user-guides/update-a-deployment) using the `launch deployments update` command.

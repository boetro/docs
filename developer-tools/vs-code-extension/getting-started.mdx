## Launch your First Deployment

First you'll need to create a new BuildFlow project that you will deploy. You can use any of LaunchFlow's preconfigured templates, or create a new project from scratch. In this example we'll use your `Hello World` template for a simple server that serves the string `Hellow World`.

<Tip>
    You can also create project this way

Launch a remote deployment with the `Launch Remote` button.

This will deploy your application to LaunchFlow cloud, and immediately attach to the deployment. From the launch UI you can track the state of your deployment.

Once the deployment is running you should be able to find the URL of the HTTP server in the `Services` tab.

When you're done you can drain or stop you deployment using the `Drain Deployment` or `Stop Deployment` commands respectively.
Drain will ensure all active requests complete before stopping the deployment, while stop will immediately stop the deployment.

## What's Next?

Now that you've launched your first deployment, you can follow the [BuildFlow docs](/buildflow) to add even more functionality to your application, and [update your existing deployment](/launchflow-cloud/user-guides/update-a-deployment).

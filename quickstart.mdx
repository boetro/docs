## Install buildflow

```
pip install buildflow
```

## Create a new application

Once installed you will now have access to the `buildflow` CLI tool. First create a directory for your application and then run the `init` command which will prompt you to enter an application name.

```
mkdir my-app-dir
cd my-app-dir
buildflow init
```

The `init` command creates a basic project structure for your application. You are free to change this in any way you like.

If you want to get started quickly you can run your application with:

```
buildflow run
```

Then you can visit http://localhost:8000 to see your application running.

### Directory Structure

At the root level there are three important files:

- `buildflow.yaml` - This is the main configuration file for your appliction. It contains all the information about your application and how it should be built.
- `main.py` - This is the entry point to your application and where your `Flow` is initialized.
- `requirements.txt` - This is where you can specify any Python dependencies your application has.

Below the root level we have:

**Application Code Directory**

This is the directory where your application code lives. It will match the name of your application. You can put any files you want in here and they will be available to your application. We create a couple of files for you:

- **service.py**: This file contains the definition of your application's service. This is where you can define any [custom endpoints](/buildflow/programming-guide/endpoints) you want to expose in your application. It starts out with a simple endpoint that serves a "Hello World" message.
- **dependencies.py**: This file will typically hold any [dependencies](/buildflow/programming-guide/dependencies). It starts out as empty but the comment at the top describes how you can add and use dependencies.
- **primitives.py**: This file will typically hold any [primitives](/buildflow/programming-guide/primitives). It starts out as empty but the comment at the top describes how you can add and use primitives.
- **.buildflow**: This is a hidden directory that contains all the build artifacts for your application. You can generally ignore this directory and it will be automatically generated for you.

<Tip>
  If you are using github you probably want to put `.buildflow/` in your
  *.gitignore* file
</Tip>

## Running your application

To run your application simply run this command from your project directory:

```
buildflow run
```

Then you can visit http://localhost:8000 to see your application running.

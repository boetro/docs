The Bucket dependency allows you to easily get a connection to your remote storage bucket (S3 or GCS) that is configured with a buildflow bucket primitive.

To construct a dependency you can use the `buildflow.dependencies.bucket.BucketDependencyBuilder` builder with the following arguments:

| Arg                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **bucket_primitive** | The [S3Bucket](/primitives/aws/s3) or [GCSBucket](/primitives/gcp/gcs) primitive referencing the bucket that should be connected to.                                                                                                                                                    |
| gcp_quota_project_id | The GCP project to bill API usage to if you are connecting to a GCS bucket defaults to the project the bucket exists in. |
| aws_region           | The AWS region to use if you are connecting to a S3 bucket, defaults to the region configured in your environment                                           |

The dependency will provide an object containing a reference to the bucket in the `bucket` field.
If you are connecting to a GCS bucket this will be a google cloud storage [Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.bucket.Bucket) object returned by the google client library.
If you are connecting to a S3 bucket this will be a s3 [Bucket](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3/bucket/index.html) resource returned by boto3. 

## GCS Usage

```python
from buildflow.dependencies.bucket import BucketDependencyBuilder
from buildflow.io.gcp import GCSBucket

bucket = GCSBucket(project_id="project", bucket_name="bucket")
BucketDep = BucketDependencyBuilder(bucket)

@app.endpoint("/", method="POST")
def endpoint(bucket_dep: BucketDep):
    blobs = bucket_dep.list_blobs()
```

## S3 Usage

```python
from buildflow.dependencies.bucket import BucketDependencyBuilder
from buildflow.io.aws import S3Bucket

bucket = S3Bucket(bucket_name="bucket", aws_region="us-east-1")
BucketDep = BucketDependencyBuilder(bucket)

@app.endpoint("/", method="POST")
def endpoint(bucket_dep: BucketDep):
    objects = bucket_dep.bucket.objects.all()
```

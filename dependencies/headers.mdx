## BearerCredentials

The BearerCredentials dependency is used to extract a bearer token from the request headers (`Authorization: Bearer XXX`).

The BearerCredentials dependency returns an object containing one field. `token` which contains the bearer token.

Example usage:

```python
from buildflow.dependencies.headers import BearerCredentials

@app.endpoint("/", method="POST")
def endpoint(dep: BearerCredentials):
    print(dep.token)
```

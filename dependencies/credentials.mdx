title: Credentials
---

You can also use the [credentials](/buildflow/programming-guide/flows#credentials) provided to your flow in your dependencies. This will allow you to import a [GCPCredentials](/buildflow/reference/api/credentials#gcp-credentials) or [AWSCredentials](/buildflow/reference/api/credentials#aws-credentials) object in any dependency.

```python
from buildflow.dependencies import dependencies, Scope
from buildflow.core.credentials import AWSCredentials, GCPCredentials

@dependenc(scope=Scope.GLOBAL)
class MyCustomDep:
    def __init__(self, gcp_creds: GCPCredentials, aws_creds: AWSCredentials):
        # Consumer the credentials here.
        ...
```

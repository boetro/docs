title: Platform Quickstart
---

LaunchFlow provides the [framework](/buildflow/quickstart), [tools](/developer-tools/vs-code-extension/getting-started), and [infrastructure](/launchflow-cloud/introduction) you need to build your backend application. Each component has its own dedicated quickstart, but we recommend following the complete platform walkthrough below.

## Install LaunchFlow

You can interact with LaunchFlow using the VS Code extension or the CLI.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VS Code Extension">
    TODO
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    The CLI can be installed via pip:

    ```
    pip install launchflow
    ```

    <Tip>
        If you ever need help with any command you can add `--help` to print out the documentation for that command.

        Some examples:

        ```
        launch --help
        launch auth --help
        launch auth login --help
        ```
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

## Signup For a Standard Subscription

To launch your first deployment you'll need to signup for a standard subscription.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VS Code Extension">
    TODO
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    <Tip>
        By signing up you will get a free 50 dollar credit.
    </Tip>

    You can do this by running:

    ```
    launch accounts upgrade
    ```

    This will generate a URL for you to upgrade your account.

## Launch your First Deployment


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VS Code Extension">
    TODO
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI">
To launch your first deployment simply create a [new BuildFlow application](/buildflow/reference/cli/init) using the BuildFlow CLI in a directory of your choosing:

```
buildflow init
```

This will create a simple HTTP serve that displays a "Hello World" message.

To launch the deployment run the following command in the same directory that you ran `buildflow init` in:

```
launch deployments submit
```

This will deploy your application to LaunchFlow cloud, and spit out a deployment ID and other useful commands to track the progress of the deployment.
For instance, you can track the progress using the `launch deployments ping` command:

```
launch deployments ping $DEPLOYMENT_ID
```

Once the deployment is running you should be able to find the URL of the HTTP server using the `launch deployments ping` command and visiting the URL in your browser:

```
Deployments
-----------
-   id: deployment_37019776288
    ...
    url: https://<PROJECT-ID>-<DEPLOYMENT_ID_NUMBER|ENV_NAME>.launchflow.app
    ...
```

When you're done you can drain or stop you deployment using the `launch deployments drain` or `launch deployments stop` commands respectively.
Drain will ensure all active requests complete before stopping the deployment, while stop will immediately stop the deployment.

```
launch deployments drain
```

```
launch deployment stop
```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What's Next?

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="VS Code Extension">
        TODO
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="CLI">
        Now that you've launched your first deployment, you can follow the [BuildFlow docs](/buildflow) to add even more functionality to your application, and [update your existing deployment](/launchflow-cloud/user-guides/update-a-deployment) using the `launch deployments update` command.
